# ShortCut
ShortCut seeks to solve the problem of finding the shortest distance between two points by listing intermediary points to travel to as “hops”. 
Specifically, ShortCut finds the best route to take to get from one city to another based on shortest distance, using city latitudes/longitudes
and a linear Mercator transform to calculate linear distances and rectangular coordinates.
